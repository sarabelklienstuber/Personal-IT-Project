##  Conduct a personal project retrospective as a journal entry, using tips you've learned from the text and this course.
* Throughout this course I have gotten more comfortable with Github and I now have a better understanding of how repositories and projects work.  I have found that through natural planning models, I have tied actions to my project with the desired outcome and have broken these down into smaller tasks to create my personal IT project. I have a better understanding of agile project management methods and the benefits of scrum processes. I have a much better understanding of how the agile movement is a revolutionary method for software development that provides adapting to better quality software systems. I have also found that clarity and decision boundaries are crucial especially with self-organizing teams. Itâ€™s important to be able to provide answers and remove impediments. For my IT project, I found it was important to understand the scope and deliverables, this provided more clarity in my IT project to understand the processes involved in defining and controlling what was included/ or not included in my project.
